## Fast and Automated Detection and Elimination of Echoes and Reverberations

The Earth, in large portions, is covered in oceans, sediments, and glaciers. 
High-resolution body wave imaging in such environments often suffers from severe reverberations, that is, 
repeating echoes of the incoming scattered wavefield trapped in the reverberant layer, 
making interpretation of lithospheric layering difficult.
This package provides `MatLab` codes for a systematic data-driven approach, using autocorrelation and homomorphic analysis, 
to solve the twin problem of detection and elimination of reverberations without 
a priori knowledge of the elastic structure of the reverberant layers.
Please refer to `FADER_Manual.pdf` for a complete description on how to use the package.
